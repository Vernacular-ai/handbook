# Values

Values shape the culture of the company and we believe that the cultural fit
always comes before the skill sets. We look to hire the best talent who are
deeply aligned with our values. We live by these values in our day-to-day work,
and especially during hard times.

## Customer First

We start with our customer’s goals in mind, invest in user research and then
work backwards. Our customer’s success is our success.

## Take ownership and deliver results

We take ownership to solve problems and deliver results. We own the results of
our actions and take responsibility for our failures. We make sure no one
repeats the mistakes.

## Bias for Action

We take decisions quickly and act upon them. We promote action oriented
behaviour rather than discussion based work. We believe a bad decision is better
than no decision.

## Strive for excellence

We ensure that whatever we do, we aspire to become the best in that domain. We
push each other for excellence. We don’t stop until we get there.

## Feedback

We believe that actionable feedback helps each of us grow in our roles. We work
in a culture which encourages continuous flux of feedback from and to peers.

## Disagree and Commit

We believe conflict, discussion and debate are healthy. Ideas win and not the
loudest person in the room or the highest title. We commit to the decisions made
regardless of whether we agree or not.
