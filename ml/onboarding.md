# ML Onboarding

Hlo!

This is the onboarding doc for joinees in Machine Learning team.

> This onboarding is unconnected to the team wide AI onboarding which is listed
> on the admin/onboarding page.

## General Process

Once you have joined and are present on slack, expect your general onboarding to
start. @abhinav will get in touch with you regarding ML specific one.

The general process is to do a quick skim of this documentation and leave you
some time to get onboarded with the logistical aspects.

Further we setup separate documents for joiners where we sit and brainstorm
which tasks to work on. Mostly we go the following way:

+ Start with preparing and discussing a list of tasks
+ Pick out one short term task, which might be boring, but gets you onboarded on
  the stack
+ Pick out one long term task which needs a bit more background and keep
  chugging there in parallel

For interns, we work on a similar doc but also add the following items:

1. A definition of what is going to be the output at the mid/end of the
   internship. At least a blog post and one Friday session.
2. A place for daily work journaling.

## Logistics

Following the accounts setup from the main onboarding doc, you should try to
have at least the following accounts setup:

1. JIRA for issue tracking.
2. Amazon Web Services for accessing machines, data stores etc.
3. Github and Gitlab for working on projects.


A few more one time tasks with @abhinav:
1. Setup a calendar event with @abhinav preferably on your day 1.
2. Also provide your info for getting up on the [team
   page](https://vernacular-ai.github.io/ml/team).
3. Remind @abhinav to add you to the @ml slack user-group.

## Work

> We tend to use Google Docs and Outline both for writing. Most of the
> stabilized pieces, not needing collaborative edits, stay on outline though.

As of this writing we follow a kanban style of work on [JIRA
here](https://vernacular-ai.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=53&projectKey=MAC&view=planning.nodetail&issueLimit=100).
On each working day at 13:00 we have [standup
meeting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting) where we do quick
check-in on tasks.

Other than JIRA, we do monthly planning which is
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MGCgxS68aE0EEnMqiKtO9wio7Y7f9ckjnl6084qXdIo/edit).
As mentioned on that doc, also check [roadmap
sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13pLR-VSABXL7KU00rjSUQvWtC3VQMyZSWXuRLOFryYo/edit#gid=1449067350)
and [definition
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IouhWoro2307NtYHaLc19-k9pVLSiRvr_BTp3fqs7dc/edit#).

Here is what you need to know before starting work:

Knowledge about the field:
1. Start skimming [the reading
   page](https://outline.vernacular.ai/share/1ab9f6aa-d348-46f5-af03-67b73f1d08a2)
   if you haven't already. This page is supposed to only be a decent
   introduction for various aspects and won't cover narrowed down items.
2. If interested in speech sided work, try to quickly cover grounds on
   featurization.
3. If interested in ...

Once onboarded, you should try to get familiar with the following:

1. our [styleguide](https://github.com/Vernacular-ai/styleguide)
2. library repositories like cheeseshop
3. data tagging infrastructure
4. data storage and access mechanism
5. cloud machine access for compute
6. docker and containers in general
7. deployment process

> A lot of these can be sped up by having structure documents to read or
> processes to follow via quick 1:1 meetings. That part is still in progress.
> Mostly we are thinking if we should have a separate session where we do a more
> in-depth dive in all aspects of the field.

## Learning

Studying and learning is an important part of being in the ML team. We try to do
the following to encourage that:

+ Every Friday around 17:00 we have a _Paper Reading_ session. The output goes
  [here](https://backyard.vernacular.ai/paper-reading/). Contact @manas for more
  details.
+ In _State of ML_ we all talk about what ML problems we are working on and try
  to discuss better approaches among ourselves. This happens once in two weeks.
  Check calendar for more details. The calendar event also contains link to a
  Google doc.

## Output

While we have been keeping many of our works private on
[Gitlab,](https://gitlab.com/vernacularai) we are trying to move to
[Github](https://github.com/Vernacular-ai) and have more open source projects
out.

We also maintain a team [website here](https://vernacular-ai.github.io/ml/), the
content part and process of which is still getting ironed out.

## Misc

+ Monthly we organize an ML Team Stuff event where we try to go out and do
  something. Mostly team lunches.
+ Roughly every month we also do 1:1. Information about this will be
  communicated to you separately by @abhinav.
